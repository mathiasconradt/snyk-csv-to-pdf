# Snyk CVS-to-PDF Report Converter

PoC to showcase how we envision a performant pdf report generation:
- fast performing 
  - 400 issues report: 2 seconds (on Mac Book Pro)
  - 2600 issues report: 4 seconds (on Mac Book Pro)
  - 100.000 issues report: 30 seconds (on Mac Book Pro)
- proper page breaks
- page numbers
- using a report/template engine (Jasper Reports)

It takes a CSV file in (manually downloaded from Snyk New Reporting UI), and generates a PDF file based on it.

You can find two sample PDF reports under
- [/samples/small.pdf](/samples/small.pdf)
- [/samples/medium.pdf](/samples/medium.pdf)

```

### Run
```
docker run -v $(PWD)/samples:/data/ snyk-csv-to-pdf /data/medium.csv
```

## Report Template Design

If you want to adjust the report template (snyk.jrxml), you can download the Jaspersoft Studio Community Edition from https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio/releases

Open the snyk.jrxml and for testing with sample data, adjust the path to the CSV file in the data adapter (/design/DataAdapter.jrdax) to point to the right path on your local machine.
You can use /samples/small.csv as a sample CSV file.

When done editing the template, make sure to compile it to snyk.jasper
